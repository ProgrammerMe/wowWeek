Textextractor2 is a OCR text extractor web app build on flask and python to extract text from images.It uses pytesserat as its OCR tool to recognise text

Tech stack used:  Python, OpenCV, flask, Pytesseract and PIL(Python Imaging Library)

Challengs faced:  It took me almost three months to complete this project. Constant bugs always gave me headaches. Hosting the app to Heroku was also difficult cause i was new to it, But a big thanks to @tinkerhub and its team to arrange a learning program on flask, half of my problems got solved by their great help.

What's your goal behind working for this project? : As a noobie coder i always used to follow different tutorials. So i started to feel like i need to do something my own, something which i can claim complete rights on. So i started learning python and it's different frameworks. Eventually i learned how to handle images and image manipulation in python after that i chose flask framework, And at the end i was able to build something my own from scratch..



How was your experience after completing the project? I enjoyed each and every moment when i was in front of my system to build this project. i felt more confident and happy to look towards my new path to coding. By doing project i learned Python and about it's different packages.


What are your future goals ? Right now, I'm working on a flutter application and i am looking forward to learn more about deep learning and mobile app development.
