SweetMemoryBlast-Game : This is a game application that is created in Flutter with good UI designs. The user have to match the same pics by remembering the correct positions of the pics. The clicks are counted. More the clicks, less is the memory power of the user.

Tech stack used:  Flutter: An open-source UI software development kit created by Google. It is used to develop applications for Android, iOS, Linux, Mac, Windows, Google Fuchsia and the web from a single codebase. Github: version control using Git. Flaticon: For icons used in designing the game.

Challengs faced:  Had Problem while debugging and running the app. Also there were recurrent errors in syncing files. The Problem were solved after I updated Flutter which took more time due to network issues.

What's your goal behind working for this project? : Inspired from the mini memory game that I play in My Talking Tom, I wanted to create a game like that by using Flutter with good designs. That's how the goal bloomed to make this project. It is a single player game where the player has to remember the sweet"s position he clicked and match them accordingly. The less clicks you make the more smarter are you. In Future, I like to add more features to it like calculating one's IQ based on his/her performance in the game.


How was your experience after completing the project? Did you get to learn anything new?? :  After completing this project, I became more confident in working with flutter and learned some basics of UI designing and I wish to upgrade this project by adding more features to it.

What are your future goals ? Which is technology stack you are looking forward to work with ?
I wish to lay my hands on Data Science and give more focus on it in future. In Addition to it, I like to develop my existing web development and Flutter Development skills to its advance levels.
